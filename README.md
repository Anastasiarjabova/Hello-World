I am Anastasia!

I have no idea have to use this.

But I will try!




name = ‘YK’

height_m = 2

weight_kg = 90


bmi = weight_kg / (height_m * height_m)

print (‘bmi: ‘)

print (bmi)


if bmi < 25:

    print (YK)

    print (‘is not overweight’)

else:

    print (YK)

    print (“is overweight”)
